Major limitations in ALMMCs is the casting by gravity route, which limits their engineering application and their characteristics/performance could be improved through faster pouring of the melt in the mould and by higher rate of solidification. Thus pressurized solidification by pressure die casting could be a very potential technique. Pressure die casting of AL MMCs has been explored over the past to a very limited extent and hence requires more to be studied systematically by varying various processing parameters like injection pressure, temperature and time, etc, to reap the benefits of the material system as well as the processing technique in practice. Therefore the present work carried out involved the development of AL MMCs Brake Drum using pressure die casting technique that could enable to ultimately get good quality castings/components."

Presently, it is dumped on land near alumina refineries. However its high alkalinity is a potential pollution threat for water, and high costs are associated with the large area of land required for storage of the residue. India is amongest the major producers of alumina in the world. Significant achievements in treatment and utilization of red mud mud have been made in India in the last decade.

The aim of our work is to define the most favorable conditions enabling the utilization of the geopolymerization process in the development of construction materials based on red mud using fly ash. On the basis of results the optimal conditions for geopolymerisation and the effect of the main synthesis parameters would be determined with respect to satisfactory mechanical and other properties of the developed LSA geopolymeric materials. The developed inorganic polymeric materials produced by the geopolymerization of red mud using fly ash would develop satisfactory compressive strength leading to use of these materials for construction industry.

It is subjected to adverse environmental conditions which   causes corrosion of and resulting in decrease in life of mild steel based structures.  In order to address this problem, research is in progress all over the world for development of advanced coating materials with improved properties of corrosion resistance and adhesion to the parent surface. Geopolymers, which are alkali activated amorphous to semi crystalline alumino silicate materials are widely studied in recent years as coating materials. In the present   work,   different compositions of phosphatic geopolymeric coating material were developed utilizing fly ash, red mud, metakaolin, phosphate and other additives by novel process and coated on mild steel plates by dip, spray and paint brush coating techniques. Coated mild steel plates were tested for adhesion strength, high temperature resistance, fire resistance, and water resistance and corrosion resistance properties. Coated mild steel plates indicated adhesion strength upto 3.5 MPa and coating is found to be stable upto 500 °C. Developed coating material compositions were tested for corrosion resistance properties by weight loss method using 3.5 % NaCl.  Corrosion protection efficiency of coated mill steel plates was found to be 80 to 85 % and corrosion rate is 2-3 times lower than uncoated mild steel. Electrochemical measurements were performed for testing of corrosion resistance using an anodic polarization method. The small passage of current through geopolymer coated mild steel plates confirms the strong resistance of the coated materials towards corrosion. Accelerated corrosion test was performed in salt spray chamber. Onset of corrosion started after 20 -22 hours confirms again the strong resistance of the coated materials towards corrosion. "
